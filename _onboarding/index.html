			start us off on the right foot. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After lunch we will show you where you will be sitting and get your going on some 
			general setup items you are going to want to take care of. Before you arrived, a 
			Human Resource representative should have emailed you a link with information for 
			you to fill out such as 401k, W-2, etc. If you have not received and/or completed 
			this work, this will be a great time for you to get started on that information. 
			We recommend you use some of your time on the first day to review this books and 
			get your computer organized.
		</p>

			You will receive a series of invitations to the training 
			sessions mentioned in the training section of this document as well as to your weekly 
			recurring meetings. These recurring meetings include daily stand-ups, weekly grooming 
			sessions, team design reviews, weekly manager 1:1, etc. If you have any questions 
			around these meetings please feel free to reach out to either your product manager 
			or your design manager.

		<div><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive">https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive</a></div><br />
